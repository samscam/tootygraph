Currently at experimental initial stages.

UI entirely-mostly done using SwiftUI

## Appreciations and credits:

This app relies on:

* [TootSDK](https://github.com/TootSDK/TootSDK) for much core functionality - huge love to [Konstantin](https://m.iamkonstantin.eu/konstantin) and [Dave](https://social.davidgarywood.com/@davidgarywood) 
* [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke) for media loading
* [Boutique](https://github.com/mergesort/Boutique) for persistence

Icon design by [Racco](https://mastodon.social/@racco)

And with thanks to [Thomas Ricouard](https://mastodon.social/@dimillian), creator of [IceCubesApp](https://mastodon.online/@IceCubesApp). What started as an idea for a contribution to that sent me right down this rabbit hole.
