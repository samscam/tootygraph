# Tootygraph

* Tootygraph is a playful, photography-focussed, fediverse client app for iOS
* It definitely supports Mastodon, but should also support Pleroma, Pixelfed, Akkoma, Friendica, others thanks to [TootSDK](https://github.com/TootSDK/TootSDK).
* Currently at experimental initial stages.
* UI entirely-mostly done using SwiftUI.
* Tootygraph is open source. Apache 2.0 license. Done for love and fun, and free forever in all senses of the word.

## Appreciations and credits:

This app relies on:

* [TootSDK](https://github.com/TootSDK/TootSDK) for much core functionality - huge love to [Konstantin](https://m.iamkonstantin.eu/konstantin) and [Dave](https://social.davidgarywood.com/@davidgarywood) .
* [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke) for media loading.
* [Boutique](https://github.com/mergesort/Boutique) for persistence.
* Icon design by [Racco](https://mastodon.social/@racco).
* And with thanks to [Thomas Ricouard](https://mastodon.social/@dimillian), creator of [IceCubesApp](https://mastodon.online/@IceCubesApp). What started as an idea for a contribution to that sent me right down this rabbit hole.
